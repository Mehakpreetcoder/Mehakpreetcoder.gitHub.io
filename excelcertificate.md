Greetings everyone!! I have completed my Excel course for beginners. I learnt about a lot of functions in Excel in this course. That , how to set table , how to use formulae in Excel and many other things that are necessary for the beginners. I enjoyed the lectures and learnt different things from lectures. I also did the practice on Excel. The one more good thing about this course is that this course is totally free . This platform is really very useful for anyone. On this platform i.e. great learning not only Excel course is available but also many other courses are available like , programming, Machine learning, AI & software , cyber security, digital marketing etc. Thanks..!!
